# NuConta Marketplace

The project uses `flutter v3.0.1` please make sure you are running this flutter version and run:

```
flutter pub get && flutter run
```

## Solution

This app was developed following [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) pattern, and use [cubit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) as state management, for branch management I use [git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).

I found two major features:

1. Fetch costumer with its offers.
2. Purchase items.

I hope the code is self-explanatory. If you have any questions, suggestions or feedback, please reach me out after the evaluation.

Happy Coding!
